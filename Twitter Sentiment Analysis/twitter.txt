part 1 
convert posts into dataframe
 here the dataframe function will take all the posts , and then convert it into dataframe
 it will have columns named - tweets , date ,retweets and likes
 and then return this dataframe for further the sentiment analysis

part 2
clean data

function : cleantxt which accepts the dataframe
 now the data is being cleaned of 4 things , first of all ,all the @ followed by name are removed
 secondly, all the hashtags are removed
  then the retweet representation is also removed and 
lastly all the hyperlinks are removed 
because all of these extra data will not help in the recognition of a tweet as positive or negative

part 3
used textblob - main part
now since the data is completely prepared for further implementations , 
we use textblob lib to calculate the polarity and subjectivity of each tweet
polarity is a float number which lies in the range -1 to 1 , and indicates positive/negative trait of text
so 1 means a posoitive statement and -1 mean negative statement
subjectivity is another property which basically determines the generalness of a particulated statement.
it basically determines whether a statement is public one or a fact
it lies in the range 0 -1 where if its more closer to 1 then it indicates that the statement is more of public opinion than a fact

part 4
and according to the polarity , we analysed the positive , negative and nuetral tweets
using getAnalysis

we further visualised our results using various methods which will be explained by gaurav.
